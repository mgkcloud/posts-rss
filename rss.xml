      <title><![CDATA[The 80/20 rule is DESTROYING solo developers:

→ AI gets you 80% in 2 days
→ You think you're winning  
→ The final 20% takes 6 months
→ You abandon ship for the next shiny object

I'm deep in this cycle with my voice app.

Building marketing tools to market the main product.

Classic rabbit hole behavior.
